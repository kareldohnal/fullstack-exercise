                One of the main focuses of our blog is cat behavior. We cover everything from why cats do certain
                things,

                problems and offer advice on how to solve them. If you have a cat that is exhibiting unwanted behavior,
                we
                can help.

                forever homes. These heartwarming stories are a testament to the power of love and the amazing bond that
                can
                form between a cat and their human.
